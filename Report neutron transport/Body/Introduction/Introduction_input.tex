\section{Introduction}
% some fancy intro about what is the context of our work 
In this work aims at assessing the transmission probability for a 
particule beam pointing on a infinite shielding. For that purpose a Monte Carlo method is 
used. Monte Carlo algorithms are a categorie of algorithms estimating
values using stochastic processes. 

First a simple Monte Carlo algorithm without any variance reduction technique was 
implemented.
